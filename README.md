Hi! 
My name is Gabriel! 
I'll be honest with you guys. I'm starting in the developer world and I'm actually trying to improve by studying. 
This project is a request from freeCodeCamp that I need to do. 
The HTML was actually easy to do, but the CSS is the worst part for me. 
I'm coding on Replit.com so it's been good for me. Sometimes I use the AI to help with some lines that I dind't uderstand.
I'm going to study more before trying to improve the CSS part. For now this is all I got. 
Thank you for reading me! Maranata!
